# Dedistract

Stupid simple site "blocker" Chrome extension. "blocker" is in quotes because
you can still use the sites, you just have to click and hold on a message for
6s first, which should help kill your muscle memory for opening up Reddit, Hacker
News, or your Facebook feed.

The extension also intentionally leaves access to some parts of the sites
unblocked, like notifications & messages on Facebook & Twitter.

To customize the message, edit the message at the top of `shared.js`.

Comes with builtin blocking of Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, Facebook news feed (still allows access to chat), Instagram, and blocking most of the "growth hack-y" stuff on YouTube.
